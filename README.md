This project was completed as part of a final homework assignment focused on applying machine learning to biological data. The goal was to classify cancer types using gene expression data. I implemented various classification algorithms and evaluated their performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices to determine model effectiveness.

To make the work accessible and showcase it on my GitHub, I created a clean, standalone version of the project in a new file. This version focuses on the core classification task and model evaluation, while maintaining clear organization and reproducibility.
