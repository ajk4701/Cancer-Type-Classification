This project was completed as part of a final homework assignment focused on applying classification algorithms to real-world biomedical data. The goal was to differentiate between cancer types based on gene expression data. I used supervised learning techniques and evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.

To make this project easier to follow on GitHub, I created a new file specifically for upload and documentation purposes. I also included the dataset I used, which was sourced from an online repository. This ensures clarity for anyone reviewing the project, as gene expression datasets can be confusing or difficult to match to the exact model used without context.
